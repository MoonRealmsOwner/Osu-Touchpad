#Osu!Touchpad

A tablet emulator for mobile devices.

#NOTE:
This is the master branch of the repo. I plan to shift over to nw.js. Checkout the branch 'pure' if you want to have pure node. The branch may not be maintained in the future.

Extensively tested on an iPad air. 

#Installation
```
npm install
node Osu!Touchpad.js
```

##TODO
video documentation!
more devices!
nicer packaging!
add QR Code support!
Figure out how to disable rubber banding on safari!
