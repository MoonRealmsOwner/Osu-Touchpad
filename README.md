#Osu!Touchpad

A tablet emulator for mobile devices.

#NOTE:
This is the master branch of the repo. I plan to shift over to nw.js. Checkout the branch 'pure' if you want to have pure node. The branch may not be maintained in the future.

#NOTE B:
You may have to compile ROBOTJS. Also, check out the dependencies it requires. https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs

Extensively tested on an iPad air.
